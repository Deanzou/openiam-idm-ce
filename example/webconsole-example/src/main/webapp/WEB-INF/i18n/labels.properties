label.reality.text=Forrester, Gartner and other leading research analyst firms have confirmed that Enterprise Software License Audits have been on the rise for the last few years. A recent Gartner survey claimed that the percentage of clients who had been audited at least once in the past 12 months was 65% up from 61% the year before. PWS research indicates that an "out of compliance situation" is found in 80% of all software audits.
